# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Goals Frontend Pages Implementation
> Created: 2025-09-27

## Overview

Implement a complete Goals management UI to replace the current placeholder, providing users with full CRUD operations, multiple view modes, and seamless integration with the existing project and task hierarchy. This feature completes a core missing piece of the personal productivity system by enabling users to create, organize, and track progress on their strategic objectives.

## User Stories

### Goal Management Workflow

As a personal productivity user, I want to create and manage goals linked to my projects, so that I can organize my work around strategic objectives rather than just isolated tasks.

The user navigates to the Goals section, sees all their goals organized with clear priorities and due dates, can create new goals with project associations, edit existing goals, and track progress through visual indicators. Goals show their associated tasks and provide quick access to related work.

### Goal-to-Task Navigation

As a goal-oriented user, I want to see tasks associated with my goals and easily navigate between goals and their related tasks, so that I can maintain focus on strategic objectives while managing tactical work.

From a goal view, users can see associated tasks listed, click to filter tasks by that goal, and create new tasks directly linked to the goal. This maintains the hierarchical relationship that makes the system powerful for personal organization.

### Goal Progress Tracking

As a productivity-focused user, I want to see visual progress indicators for my goals based on associated task completion, so that I can understand how I'm advancing toward my objectives.

Goals display progress bars or completion percentages based on associated completed tasks, show due date status with appropriate urgency indicators, and provide quick status updates without requiring full edit forms.

## Spec Scope

1. **Goals List View** - Complete list interface showing all goals with filtering, sorting, and search capabilities
2. **Goal Creation Form** - Full form for creating new goals with project association, priority, due dates, and contexts
3. **Goal Detail View** - Detailed goal view showing description, associated tasks, progress, and edit options
4. **Goal Edit Interface** - In-place editing and full edit forms for updating goal properties
5. **Goals-Tasks Integration** - Visual connections and navigation between goals and their associated tasks

## Out of Scope

- Advanced goal analytics and reporting (Phase 2+ feature)
- Goal templates and recurring goals (future enhancement)
- Team collaboration on goals (personal productivity focus)
- Goal time tracking beyond basic progress indicators

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can navigate to `/goals` and see a functional goals management interface instead of placeholder
2. All CRUD operations for goals work through the UI with proper form validation and error handling
3. Goals show their relationship to projects and tasks with working navigation links
4. Goal creation and editing forms integrate with existing design system and follow established patterns
