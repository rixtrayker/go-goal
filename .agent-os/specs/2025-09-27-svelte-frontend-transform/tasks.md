# Svelte Frontend Transformation - Tasks

## Major Tasks

### 1. SvelteKit Project Setup and Configuration
Initialize new SvelteKit project with TypeScript, SSR, and development environment

**Subtasks:**
- [x] 1.1 Write integration tests for SvelteKit project initialization and configuration
- [x] 1.2 Create new SvelteKit project with TypeScript template in `/web-svelte` directory
- [x] 1.3 Configure TypeScript settings and type definitions for existing Go backend types
- [x] 1.4 Set up ESLint, Prettier, and development tooling configuration
- [x] 1.5 Configure SvelteKit adapter for static site generation or Node.js deployment
- [x] 1.6 Establish environment variable configuration for API endpoints
- [x] 1.7 Set up development server integration with existing Go backend
- [x] 1.8 Verify all setup tests pass and development environment works correctly

### 2. Component Architecture Migration
Convert existing vanilla JS components to Svelte components with TypeScript interfaces

**Subtasks:**
- 2.1 Write unit tests for core Svelte components (forms, tag-input, navigation)
- 2.2 Create TypeScript interfaces for existing data models (Goals, Projects, Tasks, Tags)
- 2.3 Convert `/web/js/components/forms.js` to Svelte form components (.svelte files) with validation
- 2.4 Convert `/web/js/components/tag-input.js` to Svelte TagInput.svelte component
- 2.5 Create reusable UI components as .svelte files (Button.svelte, Modal.svelte, Card.svelte, Layout.svelte)
- 2.6 Implement component prop validation and TypeScript type safety
- 2.7 Set up component documentation and Storybook (optional)
- 2.8 Verify all component tests pass and components render correctly

### 3. Routing and Navigation System
Implement SvelteKit file-based routing to replace custom router

**Subtasks:**
- 3.1 Write routing tests for all main application routes and navigation flows
- 3.2 Analyze existing router.js functionality and URL structure
- 3.3 Create SvelteKit page routes as .svelte files matching existing URL patterns (`+page.svelte` for `/dashboard`, `/goals`, `/projects`, `/tags`, `/tasks`)
- 3.4 Implement navigation components as .svelte files and route transitions
- 3.5 Set up nested routing for detailed views (goal details, project views)
- 3.6 Configure route guards and authentication handling
- 3.7 Implement breadcrumb navigation and active route highlighting
- 3.8 Verify all routing tests pass and navigation works seamlessly

### 4. State Management and API Integration
Establish Svelte stores with GraphQL client integration

**Subtasks:**
- 4.1 Write tests for Svelte stores and GraphQL API integration
- 4.2 Set up GraphQL client (Apollo Client or similar) for SvelteKit
- 4.3 Create Svelte stores for application state (goals, projects, tasks, tags, user)
- 4.4 Convert existing API client functionality to GraphQL operations
- 4.5 Implement optimistic updates and error handling in stores
- 4.6 Set up real-time subscriptions for live data updates
- 4.7 Create data loading states and skeleton components as .svelte files
- 4.8 Verify all state management and API tests pass

### 5. Build Integration and Deployment
Configure build process and verify production deployment

**Subtasks:**
- 5.1 Write end-to-end tests for production build and deployment process
- 5.2 Configure SvelteKit build process to integrate with existing Go server
- 5.3 Set up static asset optimization and bundling
- 5.4 Update existing Makefile and deployment scripts for Svelte frontend
- 5.5 Configure production environment variables and API endpoints
- 5.6 Implement service worker for offline functionality (optional)
- 5.7 Set up monitoring and error reporting for production
- 5.8 Verify all deployment tests pass and production build works correctly

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Dependencies
- Task 1 must be completed before all others (project setup)
- Task 2 depends on Task 1 (component architecture needs project structure)
- Task 3 depends on Task 2 (routing needs components)
- Task 4 depends on Tasks 2 and 3 (state management needs components and routing)
- Task 5 depends on all previous tasks (deployment needs complete application)

### TDD Approach
- Each major task starts with writing comprehensive tests
- Implementation follows test requirements
- Final subtask always verifies test suite passes
- Tests include unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests where appropriate

### Integration Points
- Maintain compatibility with existing Go backend GraphQL API
- Preserve existing URL structure and user workflows
- Ensure seamless transition from vanilla JS to Svelte
- Keep existing CSS styling initially, refactor incrementally

### Success Criteria
- All existing functionality preserved in pure Svelte (.svelte files) implementation
- No .html or .js files in the frontend - pure Svelte component architecture
- Improved developer experience with TypeScript and modern tooling
- Better performance through SvelteKit optimizations
- Maintainable component architecture using .svelte files exclusively
- Successful production deployment
