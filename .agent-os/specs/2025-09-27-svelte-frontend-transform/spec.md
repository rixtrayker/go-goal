# Svelte Frontend Transformation

**Date:** 2025-09-27

## Overview

Transform the current vanilla JavaScript frontend into a modern SvelteKit application with SSR capabilities while preserving the existing glass morphism design system and all current functionality. This transformation will modernize the development experience, improve performance through SSR, and establish TypeScript as the primary development language.

## User Stories

### Developer Experience Enhancement
**Story:** As a developer working on Go-Goal, I want to use modern frontend tooling and TypeScript, so that I can build features more efficiently with better type safety and development experience.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developers will work with SvelteKit's hot module replacement, TypeScript intellisense, and modern component composition. The development server will integrate seamlessly with the existing Go backend, providing instant feedback for frontend changes while maintaining API connectivity.

### Performance Optimization
**Story:** As a Go-Goal user, I want faster page loads and smoother interactions, so that I can manage my productivity workflows without delays.

**Detailed Workflow:** The SvelteKit SSR implementation will pre-render initial page shells, reducing time-to-interactive. Client-side navigation will provide SPA-like performance while maintaining the ability to share URLs and refresh pages without losing state.

### Design System Modernization
**Story:** As a designer/developer, I want a component-based architecture that preserves the glass morphism aesthetic, so that the UI remains consistent while being easier to maintain and extend.

**Detailed Workflow:** All existing UI components (forms, buttons, modals, etc.) will be converted to reusable Svelte components with TypeScript interfaces, maintaining the current glass morphism design while adding proper component composition and reusability.

## Spec Scope

1. **SvelteKit Application Setup** - Create new SvelteKit project structure with TypeScript configuration and SSR capabilities.
2. **Component Migration** - Convert all existing vanilla JS components to Svelte components with TypeScript interfaces.
3. **Routing System** - Implement SvelteKit file-based routing to replace custom router while maintaining current URL structure.
4. **State Management** - Establish Svelte stores with persistence layer for application state management.
5. **Build Integration** - Configure SvelteKit build process to output to `/web` directory for seamless deployment integration.

## Out of Scope

- Backend API modifications or GraphQL schema changes
- Database schema alterations
- Major UI/UX design changes beyond component modernization
- Mobile app development
- Third-party service integrations

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional SvelteKit Application** - All existing pages (Dashboard, Projects, Goals, Tasks, Tags) load and function identically to current implementation with SSR working properly.
2. **Development Environment** - SvelteKit dev server running on port 3000 with hot reload, TypeScript support, and proper integration with Go backend on port 8080.
3. **Glass Morphism Design Preservation** - All UI components maintain the current glass morphism aesthetic and responsive design across desktop and mobile viewports.
