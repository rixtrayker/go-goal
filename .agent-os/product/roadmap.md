## Development Practices

### Branch Strategy
- **main**: Production-ready releases
- **dev**: Integration and development branch
- Feature branches merge into dev, dev merges into main for releases

### Release Cadence
- Phase releases every 4-6 weeks
- Hotfixes directly to main as needed
- Regular dev branch merges for testing

### Quality Gates
- All features require local testing
- Database migrations must be reversible
- UI features must work on mobile and desktop
- Performance testing for search and list operations
