This repo is meant to be like backlog for my projects with multiple views.

## Core Entities
1. Projects
2. Goals  
3. Backlogs
4. Tags
5. Tags has nested tree
6. Tasks
7. Notes
8. Workspaces

## Current Plans (Minimal Important Features)
### Phase 1: Foundation
- Basic CRUD operations for all core entities
- Simple list views for each entity
- Basic tagging system (flat structure first)
- Minimal but clean UI

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- Project-Goal-Task relationships
- Basic search functionality
- Simple dashboard showing today's tasks
- Basic note-taking with task linking

### Phase 3: Views & Flexibility
- Multiple view types (List, Kanban, Calendar)
- Flexible entity relationships
- Basic filtering and sorting
- Export/import functionality

## Future Plans (Advanced Features)
### Phase 4: Smart Features

#### 4.1 Bi-directional Linking Between Entities
**Purpose**: Create intelligent connections that automatically maintain relationships from both directions.

**Features**:
- **Auto-linking**: When entity A links to entity B, entity B automatically shows the reverse relationship
- **Link Types**: Define relationship types (depends on, blocks, references, child of, etc.)
- **Link Visualization**: Graph view showing entity relationships with different link types
- **Broken Link Detection**: Identify and highlight when linked entities are deleted or modified
- **Link Suggestions**: AI-powered suggestions for potential relationships based on content similarity

**Implementation Details**:
- Relationship table with source_id, target_id, link_type, metadata
- Event-driven system to maintain bi-directional consistency
- Graph traversal algorithms for relationship queries
- Webhook system for link change notifications

#### 4.2 Advanced Search with Filters
**Purpose**: Powerful search capabilities across all entities with complex filtering options.

**Features**:
- **Full-text Search**: Search across entity content, descriptions, and notes
- **Advanced Filters**: 
  - Date ranges (created, modified, due dates)
  - Entity types and combinations
  - Tag hierarchies and combinations
  - Status and priority filters
  - Custom field values
  - Relationship-based filters (show all tasks linked to project X)
- **Saved Searches**: Store frequently used search queries
- **Search Analytics**: Track what users search for most
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Handle typos and partial matches
- **Search Highlighting**: Highlight matching terms in results

**Implementation Details**:
- Full-text search engine integration (Elasticsearch or similar)
- Query builder UI with drag-and-drop filter construction
- Search result ranking algorithm
- Caching layer for frequent searches

#### 4.3 Progress Tracking and Analytics
**Purpose**: Comprehensive insights into productivity patterns and goal achievement.

**Features**:
- **Progress Metrics**:
  - Goal completion rates over time
  - Task velocity and cycle time
  - Time spent per project/goal
  - Burndown charts for projects
- **Productivity Analytics**:
  - Peak productivity hours/days
  - Task completion patterns
  - Bottleneck identification
  - Energy level correlation with task completion
- **Goal Achievement Tracking**:
  - Success rate analysis
  - Time-to-completion predictions
  - Milestone tracking
  - Dependency impact analysis
- **Custom Dashboards**: User-configurable analytics views
- **Reports**: Automated weekly/monthly progress reports

**Implementation Details**:
- Time-series database for metrics storage
- Background jobs for analytics computation
- Real-time dashboard updates
- Export functionality for external analysis

#### 4.4 Custom Fields and Templates
**Purpose**: Flexible system allowing users to extend entities with custom attributes and standardize workflows.

**Features**:
- **Custom Field Types**:
  - Text, Number, Date, Boolean, Select (single/multi)
  - File attachments, URLs, Rich text
  - Entity references (link to other entities)
  - Calculated fields (formulas based on other fields)
- **Field Validation**: Required fields, format validation, value ranges
- **Templates**:
  - Pre-configured entity templates with custom fields
  - Template inheritance and composition
  - Project-specific templates
  - Template marketplace/sharing
- **Conditional Logic**: Show/hide fields based on other field values
- **Field History**: Track changes to custom field values
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass update custom fields across multiple entities

**Implementation Details**:
- JSON schema-based field definitions
- Dynamic form generation system
- Template versioning and migration system
- Field indexing for search and filtering

### Phase 5: Gamification & Motivation
- Quest Log concept (Goals as Main Quests, Projects as Side Quests)
- Experience points and achievements
- Progress visualization
- Timeline journal

### Phase 6: AI & Intelligence
- Smart task suggestions
- Energy-based task scheduling
- Predictive analytics
- Natural language task creation

## Architecture Principles
- **Flexible Data Model**: Entity-relationship system that can evolve
- **Plugin Architecture**: Easy to add new view types and features
- **API-First**: Clean separation between data and presentation
- **Extensible**: Support for custom fields, workflows, and integrations
- **Performance**: Fast search and filtering even with large datasets

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go (for performance and simplicity)
- **Database**: Flexible schema (PostgreSQL with JSON fields for extensibility)
- **Frontend**: Modern web app with responsive design
- **API**: RESTful with GraphQL for complex queries
- **Deployment**: Containerized, cloud-ready
