# Tech Stack Documentation - Go-Goal Project

## Project Overview
Go-Goal is a comprehensive project management and goal tracking application designed to help users manage projects, goals, tasks, and notes with flexible views and intelligent features.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Language**: Go 1.21+
- **Framework**: Standard Go HTTP with Gorilla Mux for routing
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- **API**: RESTful API design with potential for GraphQL integration

### Database
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (currently using lib/pq driver)
- **Schema**: Relational with JSON fields for extensibility
- **Features**: 
  - ACID compliance
  - JSON field support for custom attributes
  - Full-text search capabilities
  - Efficient indexing for performance

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Svelte/SvelteKit (planned)
- **UI Components**: Modern, responsive design
- **State Management**: Svelte stores for reactive state
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS or utility-first CSS framework

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent environments
- **Cloud Ready**: Designed for cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines
- **Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring and logging

### Data Models
- **Projects**: Main project entities with status tracking
- **Goals**: Goal entities linked to projects with priority and due dates
- **Tasks**: Task entities linked to goals and projects
- **Tags**: Hierarchical tagging system with color coding
- **Notes**: Rich text notes linked to any entity
- **Workspaces**: Multi-tenant workspace support
